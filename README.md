# subreddit-search-optimizer

Due to poor naming conventions for many subreddits, it can be a hassle finding the correct subreddit for specific topics. For example if you are searching for the Arsenal FC subreddit you would likely search 'Arsenal' in reddit's search bar. This would direct you to the subreddit r/ArsenalFC with 77k members instead of what many would consider the 'correct' subreddit: r/Gunners.
         
This is a simple Flask Web Application to ensure users are finding desired subreddits without hassle.
